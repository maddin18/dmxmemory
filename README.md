This project is yet work in progress. Currently I uploaded the very first hardware design and ordered the reqired components.
Next steps will be:
* assemble electronics board
* program the controller
* check function

ATTENTION! 
In this version I made a significant error: The logic part is currently supplied with 5 V. However, the controller is not specified for 5 V on its IOs. Therefore the power supply must be modified accordingly in order not to destroy the controller module!
